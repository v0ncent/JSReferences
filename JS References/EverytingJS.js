//----data types and variables----
/* data types can be any of the below
undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object */

var myName = "vincent"; /* var just means variable and can be used throghout
your whole program */

//there are three ways to define data types in JS
let home = "House"; //let, can only be used in the scope of where you declared it

const lastName = "Banks"; //const, never changes


//----Storing Values with Assignment Operator----
var a; //declare variable to be assigned later
var b = 2; //assign variable

a=7; //we can assign the var a here 

b=a; //we can also assign one variable to another so now b is equal to the contents of a

console.log(a); //console.log loggs whatever you ask it to into the console
